This system is designed to manage and control several aspects of a home
In this project, we used an LCD to display all information, a servo motor as a door, and a DC motor as a fan. We also used LEDs to represent different rooms, with an additional LED outside the house, controlled by an LDR sensor for automatic light adjustment. Additionally, we integrated a fire sensor to trigger the system: if the temperature exceeds 30°C, the fan is activated, and if it goes above 70°C, a buzzer and a red LED are turned on.

Moreover, we connected all these components to a mobile application, allowing the user to control the house remotely. If the user enters the password incorrectly three times, the buzzer sounds, and the system is blocked for 10 seconds.
